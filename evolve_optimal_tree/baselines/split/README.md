# SPLIT-ICML
Official code for the ICML 2025 Oral paper: **"Near Optimal Decision Trees in a SPLIT Second"**.

[Check out the paper here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2502.15988)

**IMPORTANT: If you are a researcher or practitioner looking for a modern decision tree method or baseline, we would recommend you use this package: https://github.com/zakk-h/LicketySPLIT (with corresponding pip package `pip install licketysplit`)**. This package implements the LicketySPLIT method from this paper with some wonderful subsequent modifications from our colleague Zakk Heile. That version of the package runs _substantially faster_ and includes many frequently requested features, such as multiclass predictions and regression. This SPLIT repository is a historical, beta-version codebase, kept to preserve the version presented at ICML 2025, that is not actively maintained. We have expanded the method that is most promising (LicketySPLIT) to that new repository.

Note that this code is in beta. This code is here for data science practitioners, researchers, and students interested in trying our method and/or replicating our paper results. If you encounter problems, please feel free to leave a github issue.

This is an open source project; contributions are welcome!

# Installation Instructions and Quickstart

## Prerequisites (before installing SPLIT / RESPLIT)

SPLIT and RESPLIT have C++ extensions that depend on TBB, CMake, Ninja, pkg-config, GMP, and a C++ compiler.

- **Using Conda (recommended on clusters with linux 64):**  
  Install build tools and libraries via Conda, then the compilers:
  ```bash
  conda install -c conda-forge gcc_linux-64 gxx_linux-64 cmake ninja tbb tbb-devel pkg-config gmp
  ```

- **Using the system (e.g. Ubuntu/Debian with sudo-apt or Colab):**  
  Install the development packages before `pip install`:
  ```bash
  sudo apt-get install -y libtbb-dev cmake ninja-build pkg-config libgmp-dev
  ```

After these prerequisites are satisfied, proceed with the install steps below.

---

This repository contains implementations of both packages used and described in the paper. First `cd` into this repository. Then install both SPLIT and RESPLIT via the following. 
```bash
pip install resplit/ split/
```
**We recommend installing and running the package on Linux or WSL environments. Mac support is still limited, as the code has not been extensively tested on macOS**.

To run SPLIT:

```python
from split import SPLIT
import pandas as pd
lookahead_depth = 2
depth_buget = 5
dataset = pd.read_csv('path/to/compas.csv') 
X,y = dataset.iloc[:,:-1], dataset.iloc[:,-1]
# y should correspond to a binary class label. 
regularization = 0.01
model = SPLIT(lookahead_depth_budget=lookahead_depth, reg=regularization, full_depth_budget=depth_buget, verbose=False, binarize=False,time_limit=100)
# set binarize = True if dataset is not binarized.
model.fit(X,y)
y_pred = model.predict(X)
tree = model.tree
print(tree)
```
To run LicketySPLIT:
```python
from split import LicketySPLIT
model = LicketySPLIT(full_depth_budget=full_depth_budget,reg=regularization)
.... # same as above
...
```

To run RESPLIT:

```python
from resplit import RESPLIT
import pandas as pd
dataset = pd.read_csv('path/to/compas.csv') 
X,y = dataset.iloc[:,:-1], dataset.iloc[:,-1]
config = {
    "regularization": 0.005,
    "rashomon_bound_multiplier": 0.01, # Sets the Rashomon set threshold as the set of all models which are within `(1+ε)L*` of the best loss `L*`.
    "depth_budget": 5,
    'cart_lookahead_depth': 3,
    "verbose": False
}
model = RESPLIT(config, fill_tree = "treefarms")
# Options for fill_tree: "treefarms", "optimal", "greedy".
# "treefarms" will fill each leaf of each prefix with another TreeFARMS Rashomon set.
# "optimal" will complete prefixes using GOSDT.
# "greedy" will do so using greedy completions. 
model.fit(X,y)
i = 0
tree = model[i] # get the ith tree
print(tree)
y_pred = model.predict(X,i) # predictions for the ith tree
```

### Notes on Using RESPLIT

1. **Command Line Preferred**  
   For now, we recommend running RESPLIT via a command-line script (e.g., `python3 run_resplit_on_compas.py`) or a SLURM script rather than in a Jupyter notebook.  
   We have observed some timeout issues in Jupyter and are actively investigating these.

2. **Quick Runtime Comparison**  
   There is an example in `resplit/example/` where you can first run:

   ```bash
   pip install treefarms
   python3 resplit_example.py
   ```
   This will demonstrate the difference in runtime between TreeFARMS and RESPLIT.

### Common Config Options for RESPLIT

- **`rashomon_bound_adder`**  
  An alternative to `rashomon_bound_multiplier`. It sets the Rashomon set threshold as the set of all models within `L* + ε` of the best loss `L*`.

- **`rashomon_bound`**  
  Another alternative to `rashomon_bound_multiplier`. It sets the Rashomon set threshold as the set of all models within a fixed loss value. This is a hard threshold rather than a relative `ε`.

For more config options, check out the README in the `resplit` directory.
